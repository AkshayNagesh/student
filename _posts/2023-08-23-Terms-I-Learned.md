## Terms I learned
- README.md: This file contains instructions and background information about the project. It is a standard file present in all properly set up GitHub projects.
- index.md: This is the source file for the home page of the project. It is a standard file for all GitHub Pages projects. Note that Markdown (.md) files are converted to HTML by the Jekyll build process. HTML files are the only file type that is rendered on a website.
- cd ~
- pwd
- notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. These files are converted to Markdown (.md) files by the Makefile rules in the build process. The Markdown files are then converted to HTML by the Jekyll build process.
- images: This directory is the standard location for storing image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.) that support the _posts or _notebooks directories.
- make runs the server
- make stop, stops the server
- make clean, stops the local server and cleans the file
