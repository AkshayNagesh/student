# My Scrore
- I scored 59/67
- This post will cover my journey, learnings, and discovery throughout the test

# Journey
- This is an improvement from my Trimester 1 score of 50/67
- Reasons for improvement
    - More knowledge: I increased my preparation by tackling additional practice problems and taking more mock exams, which enhanced my understanding of the exam's format.
I encountered certain theories or notions that were unfamiliar to me, prompting me to either make educated guesses or research them online for clarification.

# Question 11
Answered - B
Correct - A
Explanation: The binary RGB triplet (11111111, 11111111, 11110000) translates to (255, 255, 240) in decimal, which corresponds to the RGB values for the color "Ivory" as listed in the table. Each binary group represents an 8-bit number, with "11111111" converting to the maximum value of 255 in decimal for both red and green, and "11110000" translating to 240 for blue.

# Question 18
Answered - C
Correct - B
Explanation: The robot advances forward if the path is clear. Upon encountering an obstacle, it turns right. It travels to the grid's top-right, then to the bottom-right, followed by the bottom-left, and after another right turn, it moves two spaces to reach a gray square.

# Question 19
Answered - B
Correct - C
Explanation: Between the first and fifth years, the user base experienced an approximate doubling annually. From the fifth to the eighth year, there was a consistent annual rise of around 100 million users.

# Question 22
Answered - B
Correct - D
Explanation: The spinner has three outcomes: a 1/8 probability each for "Lose a turn" and "Move 2 spaces", and a 6/8 chance for "Move 1 space". A random spin assigns values from 1 to 8, resulting in "Lose a turn" for 1, "Move 2 spaces" for 2, and "Move 1 space" for the rest.

# Questions 23
Answered - B
Correct - D
Explanation: The given expression corresponds to an algorithm that sets the variable available to true if the condition weekday is true and the miles are 20 or more. However, the algorithm depicted in the flowchart demands both conditions—weekday being true and miles being at least 20—to be concurrently satisfied for available to be set to true.

# Question 34
Answered - B
Correct - C
Explantion: This code snippet involves three executions of BotMover. Initially, it propels the robot one square ahead, turns it right to face east, and then advances it another square. On the second execution, the robot moves forward a square, turns right twice to face west, and proceeds another square. In the third execution, the robot moves forward a square, rotates right thrice to face south, and then moves forward one more square, returning to its starting point.

## Questions 67
Answered - D
Correct - B
Explanation: In this code section, the variable count is incremented to 1 upon the initial encounter with "maple" in the list. But as the code progresses to the subsequent list element, count is mistakenly reset to 0. This reset leads to the procedure erroneously returning 0, instead of the expected 1.


# Takeaways
### I learned that I struggled with these concepts during the quiz, so it’s important for me to spend extra time reviewing and studying them.
- Digital Divide
- Identifying and Correcting Errors
- Developing Algorithms
- The Interent
# Some ways to Study AP CSP Exam
- Practice tests
- Practice problems
- Reviewing concepts
- Reviewing code
- Watching AP College Board videos
- Reviewing team teaches and going over main topics from the lessons
# Conclusion
Reflecting on this AP CSP quiz, I recognize areas needing further study, such as the Digital Divide, Error Analysis, Algorithm Development, and Internet functionality. However, I also acknowledge my strong grasp of many concepts. To enhance my preparation for the AP CSP exam, I plan to revisit the team's instructional material and AP Collegeboard's resources, which are crucial for aiming to score a 5. This quiz has been an effective diagnostic tool, highlighting both my proficiencies and the skills I need to refine.
