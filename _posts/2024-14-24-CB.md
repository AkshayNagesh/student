# My Score
- I scored **64/70** or **91%**

# Highlights
- Increase from Trimester 2 score of **59/67** or **91.0%** and Trimester 1 of **57/67** or **85.6%**
- Reasons for improvement
    - More knowledge: All of the team teaches lots of content to give me an idea of the concepts the quiz tested me on
    - More practice: I did more practice problems and more practice tests, which helped me get a better idea of what the test would be like

## Question 9
![Alt text](</student/images/Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 12.13.57 PM.png>)
Answer: **B** Because some programs or procedures take audio data as input, this is not how audio data are represented digitally. At the lowest level, all digital data are represented as sequences of bits. 

## Question 11

Answer: **A** The decimal value for ← is equal to 2^3 , or 8.

## Question 26
![Alt text](</student/images/Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 12.05.16 PM.png>)
Answer: **C** Because when searching for a key word in multiple documents can be done in parallel, where each processor performs a search on a different document (or part of a document).

## Question 53
![Alt text](</student/images/Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 12.06.59 PM.png>)
Answer: **B** This algorithm will only display true if every element in the list is equal to target. In step 5, it is not possible for count to be greater than position, and count will only be equal to position if count was incremented for every element in the list.

## Question 55
![Alt text](</student/images/Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 12.09.44 PM.png>)
Answer: **B** This code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then inserts temp as the first element of the list.

## Question 65
![Alt text](</student/images/Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 12.11.27 PM.png>)
Answer: **B and D** Since NOT humid evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since hot OR humid evaluates to true, true is displayed.

# Takeaways
### I learned that I struggled with these concepts during the quiz, so it’s important for me to spend extra time reviewing and studying them.
- Skill 3.B: Use abstraction to manage complexity in a program.
- Skill 2.B: Implement and apply an algorithm.
- Skill 5.E: Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors.

# Some ways to Study AP CSP Exam
- Practice tests
- Practice problems
- Reviewing concepts
- Reviewing code
- Watching AP College Board videos
- Reviewing team teaches and going over main topics from the lessons

# Conclusion
I'm pleased with my 64/70 score as it shows progress in my AP CSP journey. This quiz highlighted areas for improvement, such as managing complexity through abstraction, algorithm implementation and application, and understanding the legal and ethical implications of computing. However, it also confirmed my proficiency in many aspects of the course. To further prepare for the AP CSP exam, I plan to revisit team-taught lessons and AP Collegeboard videos, which are crucial for my goal of achieving a 5 on the exam. Overall, the quiz was beneficial, indicating both my strengths and areas needing attention.
